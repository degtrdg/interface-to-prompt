    "im trying to understand what it means for insulators to not have conducting orbitals ie overlapping orbitals and for conductors to have them. Yeah, I don't exactly understand the difference.\n",
    "> In the last section, we introduced the idea of conductors by giving you a simple working definition. You may have asked yourself why some materials are conductors and some materials are insulators. Scientists really didn’t have an answer to this question until quantum mechanics made its appearance in the early twentieth century. To understand the details of the argument, you need to know some fairly sophisticated quantum mechanics. If you are willing to take a few things on faith, however, I can give you a simple explanation. First, we know that quantum mechanics predicts that electrons in an atom can occupy only certain energy levels, or states. These states correspond to the electron orbitals you may have studied in chemistry classes. When we put a lot of atoms together to form a solid, neighboring atoms affect the electron states. In insulators, the net result is that all the electrons remain bound to nuclei. You can rip electrons off of atoms or dump a few extra electrons onto atoms, but the electrons still remain bound in atoms. In conductors, the orbitals overlap so as to allow some of the outside electrons to be bound to the solid by electrostatic forces, but these electrons are not bound to individual nuclei. When the orbitals overlap, we say that the electrons are in conduction bands. In this case, electrons move around quite freely. In actuality, it does take a little energy to move electrons around in conductors because they collide with other electrons and lose a little energy, but we usually pretend that conductors are ideal and that it takes no energy at all to move electrons around.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me break this down with an analogy that might help:\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of electron orbitals like rooms in houses. In an insulator, each atom is like a house with its electrons (the residents) staying firmly in their own rooms. Even if you build these houses right next to each other, the rooms remain separate - the residents can't easily move between houses. They're stuck in their original homes (bound to their individual nuclei).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a conductor, it's different. When you bring the atoms close together, their outer orbitals (rooms) actually merge together, creating what we call conduction bands. It's like if the outer rooms of neighboring houses merged into one continuous hallway. Now the electrons that were in these outer rooms can move freely through this shared space, no longer confined to any single atom (house). They're still held within the material by electrostatic forces (they can't leave the building entirely), but they can move around within this shared space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why:\n",
    "\n",
    "Insulators can't easily conduct electricity - their electrons are trapped with specific atoms\n",
    "Conductors can carry electric current - their electrons can flow through these shared orbital spaces (conduction bands)\n",

When you bring neon atoms close together, their outer orbitals (shown as dashed circles) stay separate - they don't overlap. Each electron remains firmly attached to its original atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the right, we have sodium atoms (a conductor). Notice how their outer orbitals (purple circles) overlap in the middle. This creates a shared space (shown in light purple) where the outer electrons can move freely between atoms. These outer electrons aren't stuck to any particular sodium atom anymore - they can move through this overlapped region, which forms what we call a conduction band.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why:\n",
    "\n",
    "In neon, electrons stay put - they're like birds in separate cages\n",
    "In sodium, the outer electrons can move freely through the overlapped region - more like birds in a shared aviary\n",
    "The inner electrons (those closer to the nucleus) still stay bound to their individual atoms in both cases. It's just the outer electrons in conductors that get this \"freedom of movement\" through the overlapped orbitals.\n",

    "so conductors have covalent bonds but insulators do not the reason why I'm trying to understand these conduction bands so to speak is that I'm trying to understand how semiconductors work and that has a ground state where the individual atoms are like insulators but then when they're given additional energy they move to conduction bands I don't really get that\n",

    "Conductors (like copper, sodium) → Metallic bonds\n",
    "The outer electrons freely move between all atoms\n",

    "Metals conduct easily (electrons already free to move)\n",

    "why does rubbing silk on amber cause it to attract a straw? like aren't all of them insulators?\n",

    "\n",
    "Ah, this is a great question about static electricity! Yes, they are all insulators, but that's actually why this works. Let me explain:\n",

    "When you rub silk on amber:\n",

    "The friction causes electrons to transfer from one material to the other\n",

    "Even though the straw is neutral overall, the negative charge on the amber affects the electrons in the straw\n",
    "The electrons in the straw get pushed away from the side nearest the amber\n",
    "This leaves the near side slightly positive and the far side slightly negative\n",
    "The positive side is closer to the amber than the negative side\n",
    "Since the positive side is closer, the attraction is stronger than the repulsion\n",
    "This unequal force causes the straw to move toward the amber\n",
    "This is called \"polarization\" - when a charged object induces a separation of charge in a neutral object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that because they're all insulators, the charges can't easily flow back to neutralize. If they were conductors, the charges would quickly redistribute and you wouldn't get this lasting effect!\n",

    "This is why static electricity effects are stronger on dry days\n",

    "Your hands, tables, etc. can all help neutralize the charge\n",
    "Direct contact with ground\n",
    "If the silk touches the ground or a grounded object\n",
    "Electrons from the Earth can flow back to neutralize the positive charge\n",
    "Even through the air itself\n",
    "Air isn't a perfect insulator\n",
    "Given enough time, charges can leak through air\n",
    "This is especially true if the charge difference is large enough to ionize air molecules\n",

    "im trying to understand what it means for insulators to not have conducting orbitals ie overlapping orbitals and for conductors to have them. Yeah, I don't exactly understand the difference.\n",
    "> In the last section, we introduced the idea of conductors by giving you a simple working definition. You may have asked yourself why some materials are conductors and some materials are insulators. Scientists really didn’t have an answer to this question until quantum mechanics made its appearance in the early twentieth century. To understand the details of the argument, you need to know some fairly sophisticated quantum mechanics. If you are willing to take a few things on faith, however, I can give you a simple explanation. First, we know that quantum mechanics predicts that electrons in an atom can occupy only certain energy levels, or states. These states correspond to the electron orbitals you may have studied in chemistry classes. When we put a lot of atoms together to form a solid, neighboring atoms affect the electron states. In insulators, the net result is that all the electrons remain bound to nuclei. You can rip electrons off of atoms or dump a few extra electrons onto atoms, but the electrons still remain bound in atoms. In conductors, the orbitals overlap so as to allow some of the outside electrons to be bound to the solid by electrostatic forces, but these electrons are not bound to individual nuclei. When the orbitals overlap, we say that the electrons are in conduction bands. In this case, electrons move around quite freely. In actuality, it does take a little energy to move electrons around in conductors because they collide with other electrons and lose a little energy, but we usually pretend that conductors are ideal and that it takes no energy at all to move electrons around.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me break this down with an analogy that might help:\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of electron orbitals like rooms in houses. In an insulator, each atom is like a house with its electrons (the residents) staying firmly in their own rooms. Even if you build these houses right next to each other, the rooms remain separate - the residents can't easily move between houses. They're stuck in their original homes (bound to their individual nuclei).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a conductor, it's different. When you bring the atoms close together, their outer orbitals (rooms) actually merge together, creating what we call conduction bands. It's like if the outer rooms of neighboring houses merged into one continuous hallway. Now the electrons that were in these outer rooms can move freely through this shared space, no longer confined to any single atom (house). They're still held within the material by electrostatic forces (they can't leave the building entirely), but they can move around within this shared space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why:\n",
    "\n",
    "Insulators can't easily conduct electricity - their electrons are trapped with specific atoms\n",
    "Conductors can carry electric current - their electrons can flow through these shared orbital spaces (conduction bands)\n",
    "Is there a specific part of this concept you'd like me to clarify further?\n",
    "\n",
    " Copy\n",
    "Retry\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DG\n",
    "I'm having a hard time visualizing this. I understand the concentric ring type of situation of an atom where each ring has electrons, orbitals. I know that's not exactly true, but I understand there's that type of orbitals. I'm trying to understand the difference between them. Maybe we have a specific example and you can illustrate things.\n",
