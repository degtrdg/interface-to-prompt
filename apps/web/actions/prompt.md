Please analyze this CSV file using Wozniak's minimum information principle for spaced repetition. Specifically:

1. Look for questions that provide low information gain because their answers become obvious once you know the answer to another question in the set. For example:
   - Questions that are just specific examples of a general principle already covered
   - Questions whose answers are trivially deducible from other questions
   - Questions that just connect obvious dots from previously established concepts
2. Remove these low-information questions while preserving the core knowledge components and the logical flow of concepts.
3. Do not combine questions as we want atomic questions with no ambiguity of the answer, as per Wozniak's principles
4. Once you've identified the redundant questions, create a new CSV without them, keeping only the Question and Answer columns.
   As a guideline, each question should teach something new or reinforce concepts in a non-trivial way. Questions that are similar but illuminate different aspects of a concept should be kept, but questions that are merely restatements or obvious consequences of other questions should be removed.
